WinLifeSearch (WLS)
http://entropymine.com/wls/

A program to search for oscillators, spaceships, and related objects in
Conway's Game of Life and related cellular automata.

By Jason Summers
v0.70 - Sep. 2012

Other authors: David Bell, Karel Suhajda

Based on LIFESRC v3.5 by David Bell.

Requires Windows XP or higher.


Brief instructions
------------------

Sorry, but this program is not fully documented. For some things, you may have
to refer to the documentation of LIFESRC, and/or of WinLifeSearch v0.4 and
v0.61.

There are two variants of WinLifeSearch included in this package:
WinLifeSearchK and WinLifeSearchJ. "K" is based on v0.61, and "J" is based on
v0.4:

          v0.5 --- v0.6 --- v0.61 --- WinLifeSearchK v0.70 (wls.exe)
          /
... --- v0.4 ------------------------ WinLifeSearchJ v0.70 (wlsj.exe)

In most respects, "K" is better, but there may be a few reasons to use "J"
(the "fast symmetry" feature in particular). "J" is offered because I want to
be sure that the old 0.4 version is completely obsolete.

To run, open wls.exe or wlsj.exe.

Keyboard/mouse functions:
  's' or left mouse button = The cell under the mouse is forced ON.
  'a' or right mouse button = The cell under the mouse is forced OFF.
  'x' = Cell is UNCHECKED. Use this to find partial patterns.
  'f' = Cell is frozen (forced to be the same in all generations. Frozen 
        cells don't seem to work too well sometimes. There may be a bug 
        somewhere causing this.
  'c' = Cell is cleared.
  'S' or shift+left mouse button = cell is forced ON in all generations
  'A' or shift+right = cell is forced off in all generations
  'X' = UNCHECKED in all gens
  'C' = cleared in all generations.
  Esc = Pause a search
  Space = Continue a paused search
  Ctrl+R = Reset the search

You can also select a region of cells using the mouse, then point to the 
selected region and press one of the above keys to set many cells at once. 

Set up a search by choosing field size, period, symmetry, translation, etc.

Force some cells ON. Often just one in one of the leftmost columns is best. 
Or, use the Search setting "Force an ON cell in column..." to do that.

Start the search. Observe partial results. Run simpler searches for 
practice. Do lots of waiting. Try to get a feel for how well a search is 
going. The "rows" setting will usually determine how fast the search will 
run. Increasing the rows by 1 could slow down the search considerably. 
Increasing columns has usually little or no effect.

The fastest direction to search for spaceships is usually to set the X 
translation to -1 (or -2 as appropriate).


Other notes:
------------

Cells that are the same in all generations will be drawn with a thin border. 
At the lower left is a control that shows which generation being displayed.

You can access the menus while a search is running, but if you change 
settings at that time, it will probably screw up the search. However, it is 
safe to change the Output settings (I think).

You can use Edit|Copy to copy the currently displayed pattern to the 
clipboard. The format is compatible with most other applications. This works
at any time, even while a search is running.

Some symmetry and translation settings will be unavailable unless you set 
rows and columns to the same number.

The Save formats from different versions of WLS and LIFESRC are NOT
compatible.

-------------------------------

The C source code is included, along with project files for Visual Studio 2008.

Warning: The code is quite a mess. I've been trying to clean it up, but I don't
know how far I'll get.

-------------------------------

The licensing terms for this code are not completely clear, but because of
explicit and implicit permissions given by the authors, I believe I can safely
release it under and MIT-style license.
