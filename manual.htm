<h2><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>This is a program to search for oscillators, spaceships, and related objects in Conway's Game of Life and related cellular automata. In order to make any
sense of it, you must be familiar with Life. If not, you can start by visiting some of the web sites on the topic, such as
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~jason1/life/">http://www.pobox.com/~jason1/life/</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Authors"></a>Authors</h2>

<p>LIFESRC by David Bell</p>

<p>Initial Windows port by Jason Summers</p>

<p>Further development by Karel Suhajda</p>

<h2><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requires Windows 95/98/NT/whatever</p>
<p>Lots and lots of CPU time</p>
<h2><a name="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This program may be buggy, quirky, illogical, and incomplete in places. And it isn't very well documented. Nearly all of that is the
fault of the porter, not the author of LIFESRC.</p>
<h2><a name="Window"></a>Window contents</h2>
<p>This following picture isn't a typical WLS window but it shows all the elements that can be present:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/main.gif" width="379" height="384"></p>
<ol>
  <li><img border="0" src="manual/blank.gif" width="15" height="15"> Blank cell</li>
  <li><img border="0" src="manual/on.gif" width="15" height="15"> ON cell</li>
  <li><img border="0" src="manual/off.gif" width="15" height="15"> OFF cell</li>
  <li><img border="0" src="manual/unc.gif" width="15" height="15"> Unchecked
    cell</li>
  <li><img border="0" src="manual/frozen.gif" width="15" height="15"> Frozen
    cell</li>
  <li>Cells marked by thick border are not the same in all generations</li>
  <li>Selected cells</li>
  <li>Symmetry marker</li>
  <li>Translation markers</li>
  <li>Generation number</li>
</ol>
<p>The array displayed in the window represents the state of a block of cells
during a certain number of generations (one generation is displayed at a time). If you want a given cell
to be ON or OFF in a certain generation, you can force it to that state by setting
it so in the array. All the other cells have an unknown state the program must determine to support the definition.</p>
<h3><a name="OnOff"></a>ON and OFF cells</h3>
<p>These are cells set to ON of OFF in a given generation.</p>
<h3><a name="Blank"></a>Blank cells</h3>
<p>Blank cells are neither ON nor OFF. They are set to either ON or OFF state during
the search&nbsp; while keeping
the Life rules. If all blank cells are set to ON or OFF, the array is
declared a solution.</p>
<h3><a name="Frozen"></a>Frozen cells</h3>
<p>A frozen cell is a blank cell that must be the same in all generations. This means that during the search, the program assigns it the
state ON or OFF in all generations at once.</p>
<h3><a name="Unchecked"></a>Unchecked cells</h3>
<p>Unchecked cells are blank cells that do not need to be set to find a solution. The program doesn't
set them to ON or OFF during the search unless this choice is forced by the surrounding pattern and
Life rules.</p>
<h2><a name="Editing"></a>Editing</h2>
<h3><a name="CellStates"></a>Cell's state</h3>
<p>You can change cell state by pointing the mouse at the cell and pressing one
of the following keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li>'s' or left mouse button - change cell to ON <img border="0" src="manual/on.gif" width="15" height="15"></li>
  <li>'a' or right mouse button - change cell to OFF <img border="0" src="manual/off.gif" width="15" height="15"></li>
  <li>'c' - change cell to Blank <img border="0" src="manual/blank.gif" width="15" height="15"></li>
  <li>'x' - change cell to Unchecked <img border="0" src="manual/unc.gif" width="15" height="15"></li>
  <li>'f' - change cell to Frozen <img border="0" src="manual/frozen.gif" width="15" height="15"></li>
  <li>'i' - change Unchecked cells to Blank, leave other states as is</li>
  <li>'o' - change Blank cells to Unchecked, leave other states as is</li>
</ul>
<p>Normal (lowercase) keys change only the currently displayed generation.
Pressed with shift (uppercase) set the cell in all generations. Note that Caps
Lock reverses this behaviour. This
doesn't apply to frozen cells, which are always set in all generations.</p>
<p>Mouse buttons have a reverse function, too. For instance, pressing the left mouse
button over an ON cell changes the cell to blank.</p>
<p>If a block of cells is selected, all cells in the selected block are changed
the desired way.</p>
<h3><a name="Selecting"></a>Selecting</h3>
<p>A block of cells can be selected simply by pressing and holding mouse button
while dragging the mouse over the area to be selected. Only rectangular
selections are possible.</p>
<h3><a name="BlockOps"></a>Block operations</h3>
<p>All block operations are reachable from the Edit menu. However, keyboard
shortcuts appear to be more practical. If there is a block selected, the operation is performed on it. Otherwise, the operation is
performed on the whole field.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shift left/right/up/down (Shift+Arrow for current generation,
    Ctrl+Shift+Arrow for all generations)</li>
  <li>Shift to past/future (Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/PgDn)</li>
  <li>Flip vertical (Ctrl+E for current generation, Ctrl+Shift+E for all
    generations)</li>
  <li>Flip horizontal (Ctrl+H for current generation, Ctrl+Shif+H for all
    generations)</li>
  <li>Transpose (Ctrl+T for current generation, Ctrl+Shift+T for all
    generations) - the
    field/selection must be square or nothing happens</li>
  <li>Hide selection (Backspace)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following operation works on the whole field only, ignoring the
selection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear (Ctrl+Delete for current generation, Ctrl+Shift+Delete for all
    generations) - sets all
    cells in the generation to Blank. Use 'c' to clear selection.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ChangeGen"></a>Change generation</h3>
<p>The following keys change the displayed generation:</p>
<p>PgDn, ArrowRight, 'n', '.' - go to next generation</p>
<p>PgUp, ArrowLeft, 'p', ',' - go to previous generation</p>
<p>The generation can also be changed with the scroll bar at the bottom.</p>
<h3><a name="FieldSize"></a>Field size</h3>
<p>The field size can be changed by selecting <b>Options/Rows and columns</b> or by
pressing 'F2':</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/f2.gif" width="285" height="114"></p>
<p>The initial size is 35 by 15. The maximum size is 132 by 80.</p>
<h3><a name="Period"></a>Period</h3>
<p>The generation count can be changed by selecting <b>Options/Period</b> or by
pressing 'F3':</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/f3.gif" width="285" height="101"></p>
<p>Initially the field is 2 generations 'deep'. The maximum is 19 generations.</p>
<h3><a name="Symmetry"></a>Symmetry</h3>
<p>A symmetry can be specified by selecting <b>Options/Symmetry</b> or by pressing 'F4':</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/f4.gif" width="471" height="314"></p>
<p>Diagonal, 90-degree and 8-fold symmetries are allowed only in a square
field.</p>
<p>It is best to select the symmetry before you start to fill the field with
cells. When editing a field with a symmetry set, all corresponding cells are set
the same way. Note, however, that block operations (shifts/flips) don't honor
the symmetry setting -
it's your responsibility to return the field back to a symmetric state before
starting a search.</p>
<p>Selected symmetry is displayed using symmetry markers.</p>
<h3><a name="Translation"></a>Translation</h3>
<p>Translations are used in spaceship/fuse searches, i.e. when the pattern
is periodic and moves at the same time. Translation can be set by selecting <b>Options/Translation</b>
or by pressing 'F5':</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/f5.gif" width="386" height="334"></p>
<p>Rotate 90/270 and diagonal flips are allowed only in a square field.</p>
<p>The chosen translation is displayed using translation markers - the green and
red arrows. You can imagine the red arrow placed in one generation successor of
the last generation, while the green arrow shows how the same arrow looks like
in generation 0.</p>
<h2><a name="Search"></a>Search</h2>
<h3><a name="SearchSettings"></a>Search settings</h3>
<p>Basic search settings can be found by selecting <b>Options/Search settings </b>or
by pressing 'F6':</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/f6.gif" width="554" height="386"></p>
<p><b>Life rules</b> - specify the rule under which the search will be done.
Initially it's set to standard Life. Rules with B0 are not supported.</p>
<p><b>Force an ON cell in column</b> - if set, only solutions with at least one ON cell in
the specified column in generation 0 are accepted</p>
<p><b>Force an ON cell in row</b> - the same for rows</p>
<p><b>Limit ON cells in generation 0 to</b> - if set, only solutions with this number
of ON cells or less in generation 0 are accepted</p>
<p><b>Limit ON cells in each column to</b> - if set, maximum this number of
cells are allowed to be ON in each column in generation 0</p>
<p><b>Limit width of each column to</b> - if set, each column in generation 0
may be this number of cells wide. The width of a column is the maximum distance between
two ON cells
in it. A column containing just one ON cell is 1 cell wide.</p>
<p><b>ON cells must be within of ON cells in previous columns</b> - if set, for
each ON cell in generation 0 there must be an ON cell up to 'n' columns to the
left and 'n' rows up or down.</p>
<p><b>Also find subperiods</b> - in a periodic search, subperiodic solutions are
omitted if this field is not checked. The test for subperiodicity is made by
comparing the generation 0 of the solution with all its other generations.</p>
<p><b>Find parents only</b> - normally, a periodic search is performed, i.e. i.e. the last<br>
generation is the predecessor of generation 0. If this option is checked, the program doesn't
check what happens after last generation or before generation 0. This option
also influences generation sorting - if unchecked, generation 0 is sorted as first.
If checked, generation 0 is sorted as last.</p>
<p><b>Combine solutions only</b> - when a search is running, solutions are
displayed and saved and also a solution combination is calculated. The
combination contains all cell states, which are the same in all solutions found
so far. When the search ends normally (i.e. not by Reset), this combination is
displayed. If this option is checked, individual solutions are not displayed or
saved and the program just tries to find the combination, taking shortcuts where
possible. Search for combination is never slower than normal search for all
solutions, usually it is much faster.</p>
<p><b>Sort to try all gens first</b> - if checked, all generations for given
cell are sorted before another cell. If unchecked, whole generation is searched
before the search continues to another generation.</p>
<p><b>Diagonal search order</b> - if unchecked, the search goes by column by
column starting from
column 1. If checked, search goes diagonally taking upper left corner
first.</p>
<p><b>Knightship search order</b> - if checked, cells are sorted by
2*row+column.</p>
<p><b>Sort to find wide objects</b> - if unchecked, the outer cells in a column are
searched before the inner cells. If checked, the inner cells are searched before
the outter
cells. If the search sets thems OFF first, this may lead to finding wider
objects first.</p>
<p><b>Sort to try middle columns first</b> - if unchecked, the search starts at
column 1 and continues to the right. If checked, the search starts at the<br>
middle column and continues on the columns to the left and right, alternating.</p>
<p><b>First try cells near ON cells in previous column</b> - if checked, cell
ordering is slightly twisted but I don't really understand how.</p>
<p><b>Try ON cells if ON in an adjacent generation</b>- by default, all cells are tried in the OFF state first. With
this box checked, cells are tried first in ON state if there is the ON state in
the previous or the next generation. This setting should give preference to
solutions with more stable cells.</p>
<p><b>First try cells with the greatest impact</b> - 'smart' sort twisting. If
this box is checked, the first N cells in sort order are tested for how many cells
will be<br>
forced to some state by setting it to ON or OFF. Then,<br>
the cell that forces the most other cells is selected.</p>
<p><b>Try ON cells first if they have greater impact</b> - applies in impact
checking. If checked, cells are first tried in ON state if this state forces
more cells to be set than the OFF state. If unchecked, the OFF state is tried
first.</p>
<p><b>Impact checking window</b> - sets how many of the cells at the top of
the current search list are tested for impact (the 'N' value). The gray field shows
the average window usage in the last 100.000 steps (usually smaller
due to impact threshold).</p>
<p><b>Impact checking threshold</b> - if a cell is found that forces this many
cells to be set, the impact check is stopped and this cell is selected. The gray
field shows the average impact in the last
100.000 steps (usually lower but may be higher).</p>
<p>The gray fields show how useful the impact checking values are. However, they
are not updated when the dialog is open, so it is necessary to open/close the
dialog to see how the values change over time. The Impact checking values can be
changed during search.</p>
<h3><a name="OutputSettings"></a>Output settings</h3>
<p>Output settings can be found by selecting <b>Options/Output settings</b> or
by
pressing 'F7'.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manual/f7.gif" width="458" height="204"></p>
<p><b>Stop after each calculation</b> - pauses the search and displays current
status after setting a single cell and propagating its impact according to Life
rules. Useful for debugging purposes or&nbsp; to see what's going on.</p>
<p><b>Stop when an object is found</b> - pauses the search and displays current
status after a solution is found. Doesn't work if the search setting 'combine solutions only'
is set.</p>
<p><b>Save found objects to file</b> - if checked, each solution found is
written in text format to given file. Doesn't work if 'combine solutions only'
search setting is set.</p>
<p><b>All generations</b> - if checked, all generations of the solution are
saved side-by-side. Otherwise, only generation 0 is saved.</p>
<p><b>Update screen every</b> - sets how often current search progress is
displayed.</p>
<p><b>Dump to file</b> - if a number of calculations is specified, the search status is
saved periodically to given file</p>
<p><b>Save partial results every</b> - saves partial results to the
same file as the solutions.</p>
<h3><a name="SearchItself"></a>The Search Itself</h3>
<p>Once the field is set up, you can start the search by selecting <b>Search/Prepare</b>
or <b>Search/Start</b>. When starting a search, the field is first checked
for consistency. All defined cells are accepted and all direct
implications from Life rules are propagated. Then, each Blank cell (including
Unchecked cells!) is tested for ON and OFF state. If only one state is
possible, the cell is set so. If anything goes wrong, an appropriate error message
is displayed. There are three possible messages:</p>
<p><b>Inconsistent ON state for cell (r, c, g)</b></p>
<p><b>Inconsistent OFF state for cell (r, c, g)</b></p>
<p>These messages mean that the cell cannot be set this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Inconsistent UNK state for cell (r, c, g)</b></p>
<p>This message may appear during checking Blank cells for ON or OFF state and
it means that given cell cannot be set - both the ON and OFF states lead to an
inconsistency.</p>
<p>Don't be fooled by the cell coordinates, though. The actual problem may be
several cells away from the reported location - so if this happens, just
double-check the definition.</p>
<p><b>Search/Prepare</b>  just does the initial check, displays the<br>
field status, and then pauses. This is useful to see how the
definition gets propagated by the Life rules.</p>
<p><b>Search/Start</b> does the check and immediately continues searching.</p>
<p>While the search is running, the solutions and the current status are displayed according
to <a href="#OutputSettings">output settings</a>. You can use the following
commands:</p>
<p><b>Search/Pause</b> - pauses the search and displays the current status.</p>
<p><b>Search/Continue</b> - continues the paused search</p>
<p><b>Search/Backup</b> - goes back one level in the search tree. This may lead to
skipping solutions.</p>
<p><b>Search/Backup 20</b> - goes back 20 levels in the search tree. This may lead to
skipping solutions.</p>
<p><b>Search/Clear combination</b> - clears the solution combination buffer.</p>
<p><b>Search/Reset</b> - resets the search and allows you to edit the
definition.</p>
<p><b>Search/Copy result</b> - copies current state/solution to definition and
stops the search. This<br>
enables you to use the current state as the basis for another search.</p>
<p><b>Search/Copy combination</b> - like 'Copy result', but copies the combination
buffer instead of the current state.</p>
<h2><a name="Saving"></a>Saving/Loading</h2>
<p>It is possible to save a running search to a dump file.&nbsp;It is also possible to save an
unfinished definition, but it is internally saved as a running
search and so it mustn't contain any inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Use <b>File/Save state</b> (Ctrl+S or L) to save the current status to a dump
file. You should use the extension .wdf. The dump file is a plain text file, though.</p>
<p>Use <b>File/Load state</b> (Ctrl+O or D) to load the status from a dump
file.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="KnownBugs"></a>Known bugs</h2>
<p>When search has nothing to do (no blank cells are present), it reports 'no
solution'. The same happens also when all blank cells are filled by initial
check.</p>
<p>If you pause or reset the search when the screen is being updated, program
locks. If screen updates come too often, set <b>Options/Output settings/Stop
after each calculation</b> to safely pause the search.</p>
<p>Some editing is possible during search (changes in field size, period,
symmetry etc) but it is bound to screw the search so don't try it.</p>
<p>It is not possible to set a selection to ON by clicking the left mouse
button.</p>
<p>When clicking the right mouse button when a block of cells is selected, the
block is set to reverse of the cell clicked, even though that cell was outside
the selection.</p>
