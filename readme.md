WinLifeSearch, a.k.a. WLS
=========================

This is a Windows program to search for oscillators and spaceships (and
similar objects) in Conway's Game of Life (and similar cellular automata).

Attention programmers: Please write a modern cross-platform replacement for
this app, so I can throw this awful thing away. Some people are still using
it as of 2012, and it makes me feel guilty. Kthxbye.
